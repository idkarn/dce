Graphics
========

This module is the biggest of them all! It contains functions that interact with the
Vulkan rendering API with very little abstraction.

State

.. doxygentypedef:: DCgState
   :project: DCE

This structure contains the data the graphics module functions need to work.
Its members are an implementation detail and are included in the
``dcore/graphics/internal.h`` header file.
